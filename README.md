## Basic Commands üñ•Ô∏è

Let's start with the essentials. These commands are great for beginners and are the building blocks for interacting with your Linux system.

```bash
# Display the current working directory
pwd

# List files and directories
ls

# Change the directory
cd <directory>

# Clear the terminal screen
clear

# Show manual pages for commands
man <command>

# Display the current user
whoami
```

# System Monitoring ‚öôÔ∏è

Keep track of your system's performance and health with these commands. Monitoring is crucial for any sysadmin or power user.

## System Monitoring Commands

- **Display system information**
    ```bash
    uname -a
    ```

- **Show the memory usage**
    ```bash
    free -h
    ```

- **Display disk usage**
    ```bash
    df -h
    ```

- **Show running processes**
    ```bash
    ps aux
    ```

- **Display resource usage (CPU, memory, etc.)**
    ```bash
    top
    ```

- **Show active network connections**
    ```bash
    netstat -tuln
    ```

- **Display the load on the system**
    ```bash
    uptime
    ```

## Notes
- The `-h` option in commands like `free` and `df` shows human-readable output (e.g., MB, GB).
- Use `top` to monitor resource usage interactively and `ps aux` for a snapshot of the running processes.
- `netstat -tuln` displays active network connections and listening ports.


# File and Directory Operations üóÇÔ∏è

Linux offers powerful tools for handling files and directories. Get familiar with these commands to navigate the file system efficiently.

## Basic File and Directory Commands

- **Create a new directory**
    ```bash
    mkdir <directory_name>
    ```

- **Create a new file**
    ```bash
    touch <file_name>
    ```

- **Copy a file**
    ```bash
    cp <source> <destination>
    ```

- **Move or rename a file**
    ```bash
    mv <source> <destination>
    ```

- **Remove a file**
    ```bash
    rm <file_name>
    ```

- **Remove a directory**
    ```bash
    rm -r <directory_name>
    ```

- **Show file contents**
    ```bash
    cat <file_name>
    ```

- **Display the first few lines of a file**
    ```bash
    head <file_name>
    ```

- **Display the last few lines of a file**
    ```bash
    tail <file_name>
    ```

## Notes
- Replace `<directory_name>`, `<file_name>`, `<source>`, and `<destination>` with actual file or directory names.
- Be cautious while using the `rm` command, as it permanently deletes files and directories.

# Network Tools üåç

Linux excels at networking, and these commands will help you troubleshoot, monitor, and configure your network settings.

## Network Commands

- **Display network interfaces**
    ```bash
    ifconfig
    ```

- **Show active network connections**
    ```bash
    ss -tuln
    ```

- **Ping a network host**
    ```bash
    ping <host_name_or_IP>
    ```

- **Display routing table**
    ```bash
    route
    ```

- **Show DNS configuration**
    ```bash
    cat /etc/resolv.conf
    ```

- **Check available ports**
    ```bash
    nmap <hostname_or_IP>
    ```

- **Transfer files over SSH**
    ```bash
    scp <source> <user>@<host>:<destination>
    ```

## Notes
- Replace `<host_name_or_IP>`, `<hostname_or_IP>`, `<source>`, `<user>`, `<host>`, and `<destination>` with actual values.
- Use `nmap` to scan a host and check for open ports on the network.
- The `scp` command allows secure file transfer over SSH.
- For more detailed network configurations, explore `ifconfig` and `route`.


# Process Management üõ†Ô∏è

Control and manage processes effectively with these commands. This is essential for troubleshooting and optimizing system performance.

## Process Management Commands

- **View running processes**
    ```bash
    top
    ```

- **Kill a process by PID**
    ```bash
    kill <PID>
    ```

- **Kill a process by name**
    ```bash
    pkill <process_name>
    ```

- **Display system resource usage**
    ```bash
    htop
    ```

- **Show all processes running on the system**
    ```bash
    ps -ef
    ```

## Notes
- Replace `<PID>` with the process ID and `<process_name>` with the name of the process you want to terminate.
- The `kill` command stops a process based on its PID, whereas `pkill` can be used to kill a process by its name.
- `top` shows a live, interactive view of running processes, and `htop` is an enhanced, user-friendly version of `top`.
- `ps -ef` provides a snapshot of all processes running on the system, with details like PID, user, and command used.

# User Management üë•

Linux provides robust tools for managing users and groups. These commands are a must-have for system administrators.

## User Management Commands

- **Add a new user**
    ```bash
    sudo useradd <username>
    ```

    ```bash
    cat /etc/passwd
    ```

- **Add a user to a group**
    ```bash
    sudo usermod -aG <group> <username>
    ```

## Notes
- Replace `<username>` and `<group>` with the actual username or group name you want to manage.
- The `sudo` prefix is required for administrative tasks like adding users or modifying passwords.
- The `id` command shows information about a user, including their UID (User ID), GID (Group ID), and groups they belong to.
- `cat /etc/passwd` lists all system users and their information in a readable format.
- Use `usermod -aG` to append a user to an existing group without removing them from other groups.
